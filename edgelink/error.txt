✅ ISSUE FIXED - November 9, 2025

Original Issue:
"i have logged in and i am trying to create link its directing to login page fix that error"

Status: RESOLVED ✅

Root Cause:
- Dashboard "Create Link" buttons were linking to home page (/) instead of create page (/create)
- Home page showed "Login"/"Sign Up" buttons, confusing logged-in users
- /create page lacked authentication protection

Fixes Applied:
1. ✅ Added authentication check to /create page
2. ✅ Updated dashboard buttons to link to /create instead of /
3. ✅ Protected /create route - now redirects to /login if not authenticated

Files Modified:
- frontend/src/app/create/page.tsx
- frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx

Documentation:
See fixed.md for complete details of both the original authentication fix and this routing fix.

Now when logged-in users click "Create Link" from the dashboard:
→ They go directly to the authenticated /create page
→ They stay in the authenticated context
→ No more confusion about login state
→ Seamless user experience

Test it:
1. Login to the application
2. Click "Create New Link" from dashboard
3. You should see the create form (not the home page)
4. Create your link successfully
